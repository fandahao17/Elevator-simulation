# Elevator-simulation
This is the lab project of my data structure course. We are asked to simulate an elevator system using linked lists and FIFO queues.My implementation is a two-elevator system in a building with 10 floors (actually 9). I choose to emphasize the basic functinoality of the elvators so it only has a simple GUI and the two elevator don't cooperate very smoothly. Actually, The program uses a silly way to assign tasks to the elevators (simply by distance).

The program uses [StdRandom](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdRandom.html) library to generate passengers randomly.It also uses the very nice and easy-to-use [StdDraw](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/javadoc/StdDraw.html) library to draw the animation.
